# Natours Application

Built using Node JS, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose

This is a full-featured Node.js web application built from the ground up, designed to demonstrate real-world backend development skills using modern technologies. The project showcases my knowledge in:

Node.js & Express for building scalable RESTful APIs

MongoDB with Mongoose for robust data modeling and querying

JWT-based Authentication and Authorization for secure user access

Error handling, data validation, and security hardening (e.g., sanitization, rate limiting)

MVC architecture, modular code structure, and middleware usage

Cloud deployment (Heroku)

The app includes user registration/login, tour browsing, reviews, and user profile management. Itâ€™s designed with a clean UI (using Pug templates) and enhanced with client-side JavaScript (e.g., interactive maps with Mapbox).

This project reflects production-level practices and aims to demonstrate my backend engineering capabilities for potential employers or collaborators.
